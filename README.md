## Percentage of End of Life Spent at Home or in a Community Setting

The Percentage of End of Life Spent at Home or in a Community Setting is an annual publication produced by the Health and Social Care team in ISD Scotland. The process to produce this was transformed to a [Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP)](https://www.isdscotland.org/About-ISD/Methodologies/_docs/Reproducible_Analytical_Pipelines_paper_v1.4.pdf) in 2019, ready to be used for publications released in 2020 and beyond. The entire process is contained within this git repository. 

There are a number of guidance documents contained within the [SOP](sop/) folder of this repository. 
* **[Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)](sop/sop.md)** - A step by step guide to produce the publication.
* **[R Project Structure](sop/r-project-structure.md)** - A description of each file in the repostiory and how these all fit together.
* **[Methodology](sop/methodology.md)** - More information on methodologies used where R code isn't self explanatory.

The guidance documents listed above do not include any information on using R, RStudio, Git or GitHub. For more guidance on using these tools, please see the following resources produced by the Transforming Publications Team:
